# Trello's Developer and API Documentation Site

👋 Hey there,

Trello's documentation and developer site can be found at [https://developers.trello.com](https://developers.trello.com). There you can find info on [building Power-Ups](http://developers.trello.com/power-ups/), [using the REST API](https://developers.trello.com/reference/#introduction), and much more! 🎉

We no longer use this repository to manage nor host the documentation. You can use the "Suggest Edit" buttons throughout the developer site to suggest edits to any pages. You can also [open an issue on this repository](https://github.com/trello/api-docs/issues) if you have a question or comment.

Sign up for the [Developer Newsletter ✉](http://trello.us9.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=5cb712992a906406c5eae28a7&id=1754ca72bf) to stay informed about the latest changes and announcements for developers.

If you'd rather correspond directly with a human 🙆‍♂️, you can email us at [integrations@trello.com](mailto:integrations@trello.com). 

Looking for something old? Here's the [last commit](https://github.com/trello/api-docs/commit/b82e22044993924853f82709f06d67bc3b3863a2) prior to the docs moving.
