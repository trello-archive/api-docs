<h2>Webhooks</h2>
<p>Webhooks provide a way for application developers to receive notifications when a model changes. Although webhooks are only accessible through the API currently, we hope that developers working on third party apps for Trello find them as useful as we do.</p>

<h3>Creating a Webhook</h3>
<p>We designed webhooks with security in mind. Webhooks belong to tokens and can only monitor objects that the token can access. The first step, then, to creating a webhook is obtaining a token either by our web client authorization process or by authorizing via OAuth.</p>

<p>The second requirement for a webhook is a callbackURL parameter. When a model with a webhook changes, the update is fired via an HTTP POST request from Trello to the URL provided. The body of the post will be a JSON payload of the action (the action that changed the model), and the updated model. It may be helpful for you to add your own parameters to the callbackURL if you’ll be using multiple webhooks, such as</p>

<pre>https://mycallback.com/trelloCallbacks/?memberID=14&mainModel=true</pre>
<p>The provided callbackURL must be a valid URL during the creation of the webhook. We run a quick HTTP HEAD request on the URL, and if a 200 status code is not returned in the response, then the webhook will not be created.</p>

<p>And lastly, you’ll need the id of a model to watch. This can be the id of a member, card, board, or anything that actions apply to. Any event involving this model will trigger the webhook.</p>

<p>Example setup from a web client:</p>

<pre>$.post("https://api.trello.com/1/tokens/[USER_TOKEN]/webhooks/?key=[APPLICATION_KEY]", {
  description: "My first webhook",
  callbackURL: "http://www.mywebsite.com/trelloCallback",
  idModel: "4d5ea62fd76aa1136000000c",
});</pre>

<p>Get your <a href="https://trello.com/app-key">APPLICATION_KEY</a> on Trello.</p>

<h3>Triggering Webhooks</h3>
<p>Now that the webhook is set up, whenever a change on the model occurs, we will send an HTTP POST request to the provided endpoint.</p>

   }
}</pre>

<p>If for some reason the connection is disrupted, or unavailable, the webhook will retry 3 times before stopping.</p>

<h3>Webhook Signatures</h3>
<p>Trello also signs webhook requests so you can optionally verify that they originated from Trello. Each webhook trigger contains the HTTP header X-Trello-Webhook. The header is a base64 digest of an HMAC-SHA1 hash. The hashed content is the concatenation of the full request body and the callbackURL exactly as it was provided during webhook creation. The key used to sign this text is your application’s secret.</p>

<p>Here is some sample code for checking the validity of a request using Node.js:</p>

<pre>var crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyTrelloWebhookRequest(request, secret, callbackURL) {
  // Double-HMAC to blind any timing channel attacks
  // https://www.isecpartners.com/blog/2011/february/double-hmac-verification.asp
  var base64Digest = function (s) {
    return crypto.createHmac('sha1', secret).update(s).digest('base64');
  }
  var content = request.body + callbackURL;
  var doubleHash = base64Digest(base64Digest(content));
  var headerHash = base64Digest(request.headers['x-trello-webhook']);
  return doubleHash == headerHash;
}</pre>

<h3>Deleting Webhooks</h3>
<p>There are three ways to delete webhooks.</p>

<ol>
<li>Using the DELETE route on webhooks</li>
DELETE https://api.trello.com/1/webhooks/[WEBHOOK_ID]?key=[APPLICATION_KEY]&token=[USER_TOKEN]
<li>If the webhook request from Trello, when POSTing to the callbackURL, receives an HTTP 410 Gone response, the webhook will be deleted.</li>
<li>If the token that the webhook is bound to is revoked or expires, then the webhook will be deleted</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="source">Webhook Source</h3>
<p>All webhook request should currently come from one of the following IP Addresses:</p>
<ul>
	<li>107.23.104.115</li>
	<li>107.23.149.70</li>
	<li>54.152.166.250</li>
	<li>54.164.77.56</li>
