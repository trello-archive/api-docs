  <h1>Submit Your App To Trello</h1>

  <p>Trello loves showing off the tools developers have built on the Trello Platform. There are two types of applications we show-case, <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/">Power-Ups</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/integrations/">Integrations</a>. To have your app added to our listings, follow the steps below.</p>

  <h2>Power-Ups vs. Integrations</h2>

  <p>Unsure of the difference between Power-Ups and Integrations? Power-Ups make use of the the <a href="https://developers.trello.com/power-ups/intro">Power-Up API and platform</a>. They are given canvas realestate on the core Trello product. Most Power-Ups will also make use of Trello's <a href="https://developers.trello.com/advanced-reference">RESTful API</a>, but it isn't a requirement. Power-Ups are able to be enabled on boards by Trello users without having to leave Trello. Integrations are often add-ons within other apps and tools that interact with Trello via the RESTful API. Integrations also include Chrome extensions and other browser add-ons.</p>

  <h3>Power-Up Specific Details</h3>

  <p>Our bar for Power-Ups is that they should provide a user experience at the level of Trello itself. They should not do too much, nor too little. They should be free of bugs and awkward user experiences.</p>

  <p>Before you submit your Power-Up please make sure you've done the following to make review as smooth as possible.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Test your Power-Up to make sure it's generally free of bugs and awkward user experiences.</li>
    <li>Review the <a href="power-ups/guidelines">Power-Up Guidelines</a> and make sure your Power-Up follows them.</li>
    <li>Review the <a href="https://trello.com/about/branding">Trello Brand Guidelines</a>.</li>
    <li>Ensure you have highly available, responsible, and scalable hosting for your Power-Up.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Review process</h2>

  <h3>Power-Ups</h3>

  <p>We review all Power-Ups before we make them available to all of our users. It's not a super formal review, it's mainly meant to help make your Power-Up a success.</p>

  <p>After you've submitted your Power-Up, you should receive confirmation of the submission from the review team within 2 business days.</p>

  <p>Once your Power-Up has passed review, the team will work with you to plan its launch. ðŸš€</p>

  <p>Your Power-Up may be placed under review after it's initial approval if you make significant changes to the Power-Up post-approval.</p>

  <h3>Integrations</h3>

  <p>After you've submitted your integration for review, the review team will notify you that they've received the submission and are reviewing the integration. We will thoroughly test the integration and ensure that it matches with the documentation you submit. Once we've confirmed that the integration works as expected and have finished testing it, we will add a listing for it to <a href="https://trello.com/integrations/">Trello's integrations page</a>.</p>

  <h2>Submitting Your App</h2>

  <p>Our review process usually takes two weeks. Once you submit your app, our review team should reach out within 48 hours to begin a conversation.</p>
