  <h2>Submit Your App To Trello</h2>

  <p>Trello loves showing off the tools developers have built on the Trello Platform. There are two types of applications we show-case, <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/">Power-Ups</a> and <a href="https://trello.com/integrations/">Integrations</a>. To have your app added to our listings, follow the steps below.</p>

  <h4>Power-Ups vs. Integrations</h4>

  <p>Unsure of the difference between Power-Ups and Integrations? Power-Ups make use of the the <a href="https://developers.trello.com/power-ups/intro">Power-Up API and platform</a>. They are given canvas realestate on the core Trello product. Most Power-Ups will also make use of Trello's <a href="https://developers.trello.com/advanced-reference">RESTful API</a>, but it isn't a requirement. Power-Ups are able to be enabled on boards by Trello users without having to leave Trello. Integrations are often add-ons within other apps and tools that interact with Trello via the RESTful API. Integrations also include Chrome extensions.</p>

  <h4>Power-Up Specific Details</h4>

  <p>Our bar for 3rd party Power-Ups is that they should provide a user experience at the level of Trello itself. They should not do too much, or too little, and should generally be free of bugs and general UX awkwardness.</p>

  <p>Check out our <a href="https://trello.com/about/branding">Brand Guidelines</a>. Power-Ups should be an extension of the Trello experience. We want Trello users to love using your Power-Up as much as they love using Trello! You can also check out our <a href="https://trello.com/about">brand assets</a>.</p>

  <b>Power-Up Requirements</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Power-Up must provide a way to disassociate user authorization via the show-settings capability.</li>
    <li>There should be no JS errors in console.</li>
  </ul>


  <h5>Power-Ups Hosting</h5>

  <p>Power-Ups should be hosted by the development team who built the Power-Ups.</p>
