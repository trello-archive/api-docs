  <h2>Power-Up Client Library</h2>
  <p>We provide and host a Javascript library for all Power-Ups. This Library gives you access to a standardized communication
    structure between your Power-Up and the Trello web experience. </p>
  <p>By using this library, your application-specific code can be simplified to the set of <a ui-sref="power-ups.capabilities">capabilities</a>    that you wish to expose. The library is hosted here:</p>
  <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/power-up.min.js" target="_blank">https://trello.com/power-ups/power-up.min.js</a>
  <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/power-up.js" target="_blank">https://trello.com/power-ups/power-up.js</a>
  <p>We also provide a CSS file which you should use to automatically achieve a <a ui-sref="power-ups.style">consistent style</a>    with Trello:</p>

  <h3 id="initialization">Initialization Methods</h3>
  <p>The most important method of the Client Library which is required for all Power-Ups, is the <strong>initialize</strong>    method:</p>
  <strong>initialize({'[capability-name]':function() {}, ...})</strong>
  <p>This method should be called within your <a ui-sref="power-ups.architecture({'#':'index-connector'})">index connector</a>.
    Initialize accepts only one parameter, a JavaScript object containing any of the <a ui-sref="power-ups.capabilities">capabilities</a>    you wish to use in your Power-Up, with the name of the capability as the key, and the function you would like us to call
    when a capability is executed as the value.</p>
  <pre><code class="javascript">TrelloPowerUp.initialize({
  'board-buttons': function(t, options){
    return [{
    icon: './images/icon-white.svg',
    text: 'My Button',
    callback: function(t){
      // do something when the button is clicked
    }}];
  },
  'show-settings': function(t, options){
    return t.popup({
      title: 'Settings',
      url: './settings.html',
      height: 184
    });
  }
});</code></pre>
  <p>You can find more documentation below for <a ui-sref="power-ups.client-library({'#':'capability-options'})">capability options</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="ux-methods">UX Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>render(function renderer)</strong> Define a method that is called by the web client when there are updates, such
      as a new attachment. Attachment-Sections (and other capabilities) are not re-initialized upon changes to content such
      as attachments of a card to prevent flashing. render is also an important method because we may not know the current
      user's locale at time of initialization, but we will know it at render time.
    </li>
    <li><strong>popup(options)</strong> Use this method to have Trello display a popup. It will be displayed adjacent to the
      element in the current context. Pop-ups are designed for lists of capabilities or content that a user is expected to
      click on. The options object can contain: 'title', 'callback', 'url', 'items', and 'search'.</li>
    <li><strong>closePopup()</strong> This method should be used within a popup callback to close the current popup.</li>
    <li><strong>back()</strong> This method should be used within a popup callback to return to the prior popup, if it exists.</li>
    <li><strong>overlay({url:"./url_to_file.html"})</strong> Place an iframe on top of the user's experience</li>
    <li><strong>closeOverlay()</strong> This method should be used within an overlay to close the existing overlay.</li>
    <li><strong>boardBar(options)</strong> Used to render an iframe at the bottom of the standard board view.
      <br /> The options object can contain: url args - A list of arguments to be passed to the iframe as query parameters
      height Below is an example of opening a board bar from a board button. When the user clicks the board button labeled
      "Popup", a board bar with the contents of `board-bar.html` will be displayed.
      <pre><code class="javascript">TrelloPowerUp.initialize({
  'board-buttons': function(t, options){
    return {
      text: 'Popup',
      callback: function(t) {
        text: 'Open Board Bar',
        callback: function(t){
          return t.boardBar({
            url: './board-bar.html',
            height: 200,
            args: { example: 1042 }
          })
          .then(function(){
            return t.closePopup();
          });
        }
      }
    }
  }
});</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>closeBoardBar()</strong> Used to close the bottom Board Bar</li>
    <li><strong>authorize(urlWithSecret, options)</strong> Pass a URL to open as a new window for authentication purposes.</li>
    NOTE: This must be run within an onclick event from one of your iframes, otherwise the browser popup blocker will be triggered
    and may break your ability to communicate between your authorization window and the parent Trello window.
    <li><strong>sizeTo(selector)</strong> - Sizes the current iframe based on the height of the element referenced via your selector.</li>
    <li><strong>t.navigate({ url: 'https://trello.com/c/abc123' })</strong> Generic navigation to any url that can be handled
      by the Trello web client. Use very sparingly, and only as the result of a direct user interaction.</li>
    <li><strong>t.showCard('abc123')</strong> bring up the card details (card back) for an open (non-archived) card on the current
      board by id (or idShort). Only use as the result of a direct user interaction.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="data-methods">Data Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>iframe()</strong> Get access to the t object within an iframe</li>
    <li><strong>set(scope, visibility, name, value)</strong> Used to store some persistent data in Trello's database. Multiple
      keys can be included in a single call - e.g. <i>t.set('board', 'shared', { key: 'value', otherKey: 55, moreKeys: false }).</i>.
      The Power-Up provides a scope (organization, board, or card) and the visibility of the data (i.e. whether it's ‘shared’
      with everyone that can see the org/board/card or if it's ‘private’) and a string to store. Power-Ups are allowed to
      store 4K of data for each scope/visibility pair and the current Power-Ups store stringified JSON. Using `t.set` will
      re-initialize your Power-Up in it’s entirety by re-executing all capabilities. Read more about data storage in the
      <a ui-sref="power-ups.topics({'#':'data-storage'})">topics section</a>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>get(scope, visibility, name, defaultValue)</strong> Used to get the stored data, at the specified scope and visibility,
      from the given key for the Power-Up. If defaultValue is provided and there is not a value for the given key, the defaultValue
      will be returned.</li>
    <li><strong>getAll(scope, visibility, name, defaultValue)</strong> Used to return all pluginData in scope. For instance,
      if you have a card in context you will get back private and shared pluginData on the organization, board, and that
      card. If a card is not in context, you will get back private and shared pluginData on just the organization and board
      scopes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>remove(scope, visibility, name)</strong> Used to delete the given keys and values from pluginData. <i>name</i>      should be the name of the key to remove; it can be either a single string or an array of strings for which keys to
      remove (e.g. <i>t.remove('organization', 'shared', ['key1', 'key2', 'key3']</i></li>
    <li><strong>attach({url:URL, name:Name})</strong> Attach a new URL to the card in the current context.</li>
    <li><strong>signUrl(URL)</strong> Sign a URL for use with <strong>attachment-sections</strong> only.</li>
    <li><strong>localizeKey(key, data)</strong> Localize a string by key</li>
    <li><strong>localizeKeys(keys)</strong> Localize a list of strings or objects. You can read more about internationalizationa
      and localization in the <a ui-sref="power-ups.topics({'#':'internationalization'})">topics section</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>board(field1, field2, ...)</strong> Returns a promise with information about the board for the current context.
      Valid fields include: 'id', 'name', 'url', 'shortLink', 'members', 'dateLastActivity', 'all'</li>
    <li><strong>list(field1, field2, ...)</strong> Returns a promise with information about the list for the current context
      Valid fields include: 'id', 'name', 'cards', 'all'</li>
    <li><strong>card(field1, field2, ...)</strong> Returns a promise with information about the card for the current context.
      The information available is only when a specific card is in context. For instance, this function will return information
      about a card successfully inside of the capabilities 'attachment-sections' and 'card-badges', but not 'show-settings'
      nor 'board-buttons'. The latter are not within the context of a single card. Valid fields include: 'id', 'name', 'desc',
      'due', 'closed', 'cover', 'attachments', 'members', 'labels', 'url', 'shortLink', 'idList', 'idShort', 'dateLastActivity', 'badges', 'all'
      <br />
      <br /> Example usage:
      <pre><code class="javascript">t.card('id', 'name', 'url')
.then(function(promiseResult) {
  console.log(promiseResult);
});</code></pre>
      <pre><code class="javascript">{
  id: "72hejh3iuruyr87rhiu",
  name: "Card Name",
  url: "https://trello.com/c/38UCRu1a/card-name"
}</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>t.lists</strong> Takes same args as <i>t.list</i> but gives back all open lists on the board</li>
    <li><strong>t.member</strong> Accepted fields: 'id', 'fullName', 'username', 'avatar', 'all'. This is an easy way to get information
      about active members. 'avatar' returns the complete URL for the 50px png file.</li>
    <li><strong>t.cards</strong> Takes same args as <i>t.card</i> but gives back all open cards on the board.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="capability-options">Capability Options</h3>
  <p>Each capability that you include in your initialization will take a reference to the <strong>t</strong> object and a options
    or context object. This object will include various things depending on the capability.</p>
