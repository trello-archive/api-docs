  <h2>Power-Ups Introduction</h2>
  <p>Power-Ups are powerful independent modules that allow developers to modify the Trello experience while still maintaining member control. Power-Ups represent the ability to enrich the experience of members by modifying and improving their interactions with Boards and Cards.
  </p>
  <p>
  Our current set of Power-Ups has some great examples of what the platform can do. Learn more about our <a href="http://blog.trello.com/github-and-trello-integrate-your-commits/?utm_source=integrations&utm_medium=web">GitHub Power-Up</a>, or our <a href="http://blog.trello.com/trello-salesforce-integration/?utm_source=integrations&utm_medium=web">Salesforce Power-Up</a>.</p>

  <p>Power-Ups gain read-only access to member information as members interact with the Power-Up. Power-Ups can make Attachments to Cards and can store Power-Up specific data, but are restricted from making other changes.</p>

  <h3>Power-Up Samples</h3>
  <p>Trello has built some sample Power-Ups that you can use to get started developing right away. These samples demonstrate the capabilities of the platform and should help you to get started.</p>

  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>Interested in building your own Power-Up? First, clone/download our samples above, or get started by building your own <a ui-sref="power-ups.architecture({'#':'manifest'})">manifest and index connector</a>. Once you've got something ready and hosted via HTTPS, you'll just need a Trello team for which you want your Power-Up available.</p>

  <p>You will need to be a team admin for the Trello team you want to add your Power-Up to. It doesn't matter whether the team is free or paid. Click below to get started. We'll need your Power-Up's Name and an HTTPS based manifest to get you setup.</p>
