  <h1>Power-Up Guidelines</h1>
  <p>These guidelines are meant to help you make a great Power-Up. They are not hard and fast rules - our main goal is to make sure you are successful by delivering an awesome Power-Up that our users love.</p>

  <h2>Guiding Principles</h2>

  <h3>Provide a contextual and shared experience</h3>
  <p>Once enabled Power-Ups become a part of the board. Trello users will expect your Power-Up to be tightly tied to the board, and provide a consistent experience to all board members.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not ask the user to select which board they would like to use.</li>
    <li>Do not show two entirely different views to two different users. Functionality should be tied to the board, not the user.</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Make it an extension of Trello</h3>
  <p>The best Power-Ups make Trello able to do something that it was not able to do before. They are simple but powerful. They fit in naturally and complement Trello in delightful new ways.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Where possible use the provided styles.</li>
    <li>Do not ask the user questions you already know the answer to. The Power-Up library provides you with a lot of contextual information. If you need more, let us know.</li>
    <li>Ensure your Power-Up works across the same browsers Trello does. <a href="https://trello.com/platforms">Supported Platforms.</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Keep it simple and delightful</h3>
  <p>Power-Ups are powerful, but not complicated, clunky or awkward to use.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Prioritize the user experience over everything else. Cut features if you have to.</li>
    <li>If you also have a web app, do not simply embed it. Think deeply about the best subset of functionality that makes sense in Trello. It's okay to require users to pop-out to your web app for the full functionality.</li>
    <li>Do not rely or prompt for a browser extension for full functionality. If you need something to make your Power-Up work, please let us know.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other general requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Power-Up must provide a way to disassociate user authorization via the show-settings capability.</li>
    <li>There should be no JS errors in console.</li>
    <li>The Power-Up should be named such that it does not make use of overly generic terms, e.g. "Calendar" or "Agile". However, it may be named with a generic term if it is followed by a "by Company Name" statement - e.g. "Calendar by Trello, Inc." is acceptable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Capabilities</h2>

  <h3>Attachment Sections</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Use this to show additional information about an attachment that your service knows about.</li>
    <li>Make it obvious what attachments have been pulled out into your sections.</li>
    <li>Make it clear how the user could navigate to the original content at the URL(s) that were claimed for the section.</li>
    <li>Names for attachment sections should be unique and easy to understand.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Use attachment-sections when the information you are adding can be handled by attachment-thumbnails.</li>
    <li>Re-render the entire section if an item is added to or removed from it, this leads to flashing.</li>
    <li>Use more vertical space than is required for the content.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Attachment Thumbnails</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Use this to show additional structured information about an attachment your service knows about</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Respond to attachment-thumbnail requests for attachments your integration doesn’t logically provide additional useful information for.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Board Buttons</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Use this when you have common actions that are applicable to the entire board.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>

  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide more buttons than is necessary. Most Power-Ups need only one button. If necessary use a single button that opens a popup with a list of further options.</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Card Badges</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>

    <li>Provide badge content that is so long it clips.</li>
    <li>Refresh on an interval shorter than is necessary.</li>
    <li>Use badge colors when not logical.</li>
    <li>Provide more badges than necessary. Most Power-Ups only require adding a single badge to cards.</li>

    <li>Provide a sensible and short title for each badge.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Abuse colors where not logical.</li>
    <li>Provide more badges than necessary.</li>
    <li>Refresh on an interval shorter than is necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Card From URL</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>

  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Create cards for URLs not obviously associated with your Power-Up.</li>
    <li>Clutter the card by adding more content to the description or title than makes sense and is necessary.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Format URL</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Try to account for the different variations a url may have to represent a single entity. /item/123 and ?item=123 may represent the same item in some cases.</li>
    <li>Provide an appropriate icon with the URL where possible, especially for branding purposes (make sure you own the copyright where applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Return the URL largely as is, but just with an icon. Your Power-Up should add value.</li>
    <li>Return content for URLs that aren’t logically associated with your Power-Up functionality (the Google Drive Power-Up doesn’t try to format Dropbox URLs).</li>
    <li>Return a colored icon.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Show Settings</h3>

  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Use this for content or functionality that are core to the Power-Up. Your Power-Up should function well by default without the user ever needing to go here.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Controls</h2>

  <h3>In General:</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep it clean and simple.</li>
    <li>Performance is important, try to make your experiences feel “native.”</li>
    <li>Use Trello’s provided CSS: <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups/power-up.css">https://trello.com/power-ups/power-up.css</a></li>
    <li>Your Power-Up should respond quickly to all capability methods.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>The Power-Up's functionality should include more than just linking a user to your site.</li>
    <li>Override Trello’s CSS except where necessary, for example to preserve certain band identity.</li>
    <li>Don't inject a chat/messanger widget or other tools that disrupt the Trello experience.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Popup</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Prefer this control over overlay, whenever possible because it maintains context better.</li>
    <li>Minimize the number of height resizes you do.</li>
    <li>When using a popup for search, make use of the built-in search functionality instead of using your own custom search iframe.</li>
  </ul>
  <b>Don’ts:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Have horizontally scrolling content in the popup.</li>
    <li>Have vertically scrolling content in the popup (except where long lists make sense).</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Board Bar</h3>
  <b>Dos:</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Resize to the perfect height for your content.</li>
    <li>Keep the height as minimal as possible for the content.</li>
  </ul>

  <ul>
    <li>Make the content in the board bar distracting from the board. A board bar should not be so large that it covers the entire Trello web view.</li>

  </ul>
  <h3>Overlay</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Cover the entire Trello board.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>General Topics</h2>
  <h3>Data Storage</h3>

    <li>Make use of <pre>t.set</pre> and <pre>t.get</pre> for storing simpler data such as settings/preferences.</li>
    <li>When storing more complex data, store a reference to it externally with <pre>t.set</pre>.</li>
    <li>Use the ‘private’ scope when storing confidential or sensitive information, such as tokens.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Store data in other Trello fields like card descriptions or comments.</li>
  </ul>
